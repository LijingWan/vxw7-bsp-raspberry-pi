# Overview

This document describes the features of the rpi_3 BSP/PSL, which is designed
to run on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+ board. This is an ARM Cortex-A53
processor-based platform.

# Prerequisite(s)

* You must have Wind River速 VxWorks速 7 SR0610 released source code and
  development environment to support "Raspberry Pi 3B/B+ unsupported BSP".

# Building and Using

### Setup

Checkout feature of GitHub to place the contents of this repository 
in your VxWorks速 install tree at an appropriate location:
```Bash
cp -r os/board/unsupported/rpi_3 ***installDir***/vxworks-7/pkgs_v2/os/board/unsupported

cp -r os/psl/unsupported/bcm2837  ***installDir***/vxworks-7/pkgs_v2/os/psl/unsupported

```
### Building

The building process comprises three parts, U-Boot, VSB project and VIP project.
U-Boot is open source code that can be got from related official server.
The building process of these three parts are all described in target.txt.
Target.txt can be found under os/board/unsupported/rpi_3 directory.

### Drivers

By now, VxWorks 7 based released SR0610 is supported by this BSP, and some
common drivers are also supported by PSL as below:
